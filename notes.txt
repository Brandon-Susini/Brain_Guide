Brain Insights:
	F7 - Facilitates empathy. Can just look like empathy since it's copying rather than truly feeling.
		What region would help with understanding what you're feeling? That region must play a part.
		T6 - "Imagine yourself in a complex system" (someone elses life)
			"Envision your future" (or an imagined future)
			"Notice abstract spatial-strucutral relationships"
		F8 - Identify what we believe (imagine new belief structures and make them real to us)
			"Ignore context" - Forget that this is a contextual excersize. Treat it like reality.



Type Hightlights based on level of activity
	SiFe - Low F7, lack imagination and empathy
		Very High C4 - Artistic ability, wholistic memory recall, recall whole body affect (intune with their internal sensations)
	TiSe - Low F7, lack imagination and empathy
